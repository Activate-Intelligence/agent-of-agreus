## Key Commentary

> "Hiring activity remained relatively muted, with the majority of Family Offices reporting no changes to their team structures. This must be the reflection of the uncertain markets and the lack of willingness to risk growing teams at such times, and focusing on maximizing existing teams."

> "While Family Offices have traditionally emphasized cultural and personal development benefits of working in those organizations, there is now more employee attention on compensation, especially at senior levels. To stay competitive, many are revisiting their reward structures and incorporating variable pay for performance." - Chris Barnes, KPMG

## Recruitment Challenges

1. **Finding candidates who can operate beyond job descriptions**
2. **Cultural fit assessment**
3. **Competing with structured industries on compensation**
4. **Balancing family dynamics with professional standards**
5. **Retaining talent in competitive market**
6. **Succession planning gaps**

## Compensation Benchmarking Need

Family Offices increasingly need to:
- Benchmark against broader market
- Structure competitive packages
- Introduce variable/performance pay
- Consider tax efficiency
- Balance fixed and variable components
