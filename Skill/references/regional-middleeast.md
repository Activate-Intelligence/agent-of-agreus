## Key Commentary

> "The UAE has rapidly established itself as one of the world's most attractive bases for Family Offices. Its appeal rests first on tax advantages: no income or capital gains or inheritance tax. Equally compelling are its progressive policies: 100 percent foreign ownership, investor-friendly regulations, and dedicated frameworks for Family Offices." - Jorge Felippe, CEO, Almulla Capital

> "Attracting and retaining top talent is fundamental to the long-term success of any Family Office. Unlike corporates, where brand equity carries weight, a Family Office competes directly with global institutions, private equity firms, and sovereign wealth funds for the same calibre of professionals."
