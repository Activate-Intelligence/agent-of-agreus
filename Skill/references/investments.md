## Key Commentary

> "The higher levels of economic uncertainty affecting the deals market over the last few years introduced an opportunity for Family Offices to ride the wave and play a more significant role through increasing their direct investment strategies. Given their ability to take a longer term view when compared with traditional private equity, and to focus on more than just the financial return, founders are increasingly looking to build Family Offices into their processes to seek investment." - Helen Roxburgh, KPMG UK

## Investment Strategy Observations

1. **Direct investment appetite**: Growing as Family Offices leverage patient capital advantage
2. **Impact investing**: Punching above weight due to purpose-aligned strategies
3. **Strategic alignment**: Beyond financial return, considering broader impact
4. **Geographic diversification**: Priority given global uncertainty
5. **Private markets**: Continued growth in private equity and credit allocations
6. **Real assets**: Strong allocation for inflation protection
7. **Digital assets**: Still nascent (~80% not invested) but growing interest from NextGen

## CIO Compensation Context

- CIO compensation tied to investment performance
- Bonus structures often linked to fund returns
- LTIP (carried interest, co-invest) common for investment team
- Higher compensation at larger AUM family offices
- Competition with PE, hedge funds, asset managers for talent
