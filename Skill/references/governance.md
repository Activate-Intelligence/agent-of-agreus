# Governance Focus

## Overview

Family Offices have traditionally been characterised by weak governance. However, increased awareness is driving adoption of formal structures as:
- Suppliers demand better decision-making
- Regulators increase requirements
- Complexity of Family Office ecosystem grows

## Three Pillars of Family Office Governance

### 1. Investment Governance
- Investment Policy Statement (IPS)
- Investment Committee
- Dedicated investment team/CIO
- Structured oversight and decision-making
- Performance benchmarking

### 2. Operational Governance
- Formalised processes
- Risk management
- Compliance frameworks
- Reporting structures
- Technology infrastructure

### 3. Family Office Governance
- Succession planning
- Next generation involvement
- Family constitution/charter
- Communication protocols
- Conflict resolution mechanisms

## Legal Structures

| Structure | % of Family Offices |

| Partnership | 9% |
| Foundation | 5% |

## Succession Planning

| Status | Global % |
|--------|----------|

### Regional Variations
- UK: 41% have succession plan
- USA: 39% have succession plan (61% do not)
- Middle East: 50% have succession plan
- Australia: Improving

**Key concern**: Just over half have defined succession planning during peak wealth transfer period

## Reporting Lines

| At least one family member | 72% |
| Multiple family members | 35% |
| The Board | Significant |

## Standalone vs Embedded

| Structure | % |
|-----------|---|
| Standalone entity | 79% |
| Embedded in operating business | 21% |

**Trend**: Movement toward standalone entities with enhanced governance

## Maturity Journey

Family Offices progress through stages:
1. **Embedded**: Within operating business
2. **Standalone establishment**: Formal separation
3. **Professionalisation**: Structured processes
4. **Institutionalisation**: Full governance framework

## Generational Dynamics

| Generations Served | 2023 | 2025 |
|--------------------|------|------|
| 1 generation | - | 28% |
| 2 generations | 38% | 43% |
| 3 generations | - | 23% |
| 4+ generations | 10% | 6% |

**Key finding**: Majority serve 2 generations; fewer serve 4+ (branch separation occurring)

## Family Office Purpose Evolution

| Purpose | Priority |
|---------|----------|
| Wealth preservation | Primary (up from 2023) |
| Administration of family wealth | Secondary (was primary in 2023) |
| Risk-adjusted growth | Third |
| Philanthropic initiative | Fourth (growing) |

**Shift**: From administration to preservation signals long-term, strategic mindset

## Years in Operation

| Duration | % |
|----------|---|
| 0-2 years | New entrants |
| 3-5 years | Developing |
| 6-10 years | Established |
| 10+ years | Mature (majority) |

## Key Commentary

> "We are at a time when the absence of controllable 'governance' stands out as the biggest risk facing Family Offices. Whilst external forces may impact the value of financial capital, the lack of effective governance, during a period of great transition, will erode the value of family capital and lead to the dissipation of family relationships and wealth." - Keith Drewery, KPMG Australia

> "Over the past few years, governance practices have evolved considerably, with Family Offices enhancing the depth and quality of their committees and reporting. The challenge for some remains simply getting started and understanding where to begin."

4. **Complexity** - Balancing family and institutional needs
5. **Succession gaps** - Nearly half without plans

## Global Footprint Expansion

| Locations | 2023 | 2025 |
